### Project Title
BikeShare

### Description
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

In this project, we will use data provided by Motivate(file data .csv), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We  will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
